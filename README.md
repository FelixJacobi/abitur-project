# abitur-project
My project for oral exam of German Abitur in 2017

**Note**: This is not any kind of production-ready code.

It reflects my level of knowledge in object-oriented PHP development in 2017 (when I had just three quarters of a year of experience with it). I warn you not to use this as a template for any productive project.

The project was provided for documentation und entertaining purposes only.
